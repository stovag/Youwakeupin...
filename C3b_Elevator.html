			<p> You get in the elevator, followed by your parents. They don't seem</p>
      <p> to like the idea of the elevator but they get in nonetheless. The</p>
      <p> elevator descends, but you hear a few weird noises coming from the</p>
      <p> ropes. Luckily nothing happens and you feel both relieved and a bit</p>
      <p> worried about what could have happened. You go outside and see a lot of</p>
      <p> people on the street, horrified and sorrowful, with many children crying</p>
      <p> What do you do?</p>
