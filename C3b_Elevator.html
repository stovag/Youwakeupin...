			<p> You get in the elevator, followed by your parents. They don't seem</p>
      <p> to like the idea of the elevator but they get in nonetheless. The</p>
      <p> the elevator descends, but you hear a few weird noises coming from </p>
      <p> the ropes. Luckily nothing happens and you feel both relieved and </p>
      <p> a bit worried about what could have happened. You get off the elevator</p>
      <p> and go outside. You see a lot of people being out, and many more getting</p>
      <p> out of their homes. People are sad, scared and a few kids are crying.</p>
      <p> What do you do?</p>
